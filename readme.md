Modern is the first theme of a series of Hiby R3 and R3 Pro themes. 
The theme aims to change the default ui to that of a "modern" iPod classic if such a thing were to exist. 

The theme is built up of various recreated iOS elements as well as custom elements for "apps" or settings that do not exist. The colours of the entire theme are based upon iOS and Apple Music but modified slightly to for a "vanilla" experience on the Hiby R3.

Animations have also been updated where appropriate to fit the theme. Unfortunately not all animations can be changed due to the way themes are stored on the system. You may also find some images clip onto others but that is also something that cannot be fixed due to the way the system handles transparency.


**Modern supports Hiby R3 and R3 pro with any system version and custom firmware also. The release download is only for the most up to date system firmware at the time of release any over version will require packaging the theme yourself using the Hiby Theme tool. Read installation for guide.**
